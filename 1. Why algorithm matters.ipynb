While in second version, the cost time increased by almost 150 times! This is just an example of comparison between linear & quadratic growth, but it can actually tell us how important it is to design a proper algorithm for our problem."

Or in other words, solution 3 is making compromise on space to win the gain on running time. The key point here is that it's always hard to get the least running time with allocating the least space for that program. Actually this is the case we are going to face everytime: to balance between **space and time**.  \n"
